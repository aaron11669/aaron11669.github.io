## About Me
I'm currently a Research Engineer II at the Texas A&M University Engineering Experiment Station. I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Irvine. I am ~50% of the way through my part-time master’s degree at Purdue University, where I am specializing in autonomy and control systems. Previously, I was an Operations Engineer at a robotics startup called Stellar Pizza. Before that, I interned at Tesla, SpaceX, and Northrop Grumman, primarily working on test engineering.

My research interests lie in robot–environment interaction. As such, many of my projects involve utilizing my understanding of control systems, perception/sensing, localization, and path planning. As I dive deeper into my studies, I am also beginning to utilize optimization-based approaches like model predictive control and graph-based localization.
